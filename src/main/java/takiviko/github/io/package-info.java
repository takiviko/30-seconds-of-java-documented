        Inspired by [30 seconds of code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code),
        this is a collection of reusable tested copy-pasteable Java 17 compatible code snippets
        that you can understand in 30 seconds or less.
                
        If you're interested in contributing to this library, please see the
        [instructions](https://github.com/iluwatar/30-seconds-of-java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md).
